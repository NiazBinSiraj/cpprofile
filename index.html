            <h4>Hi!</h4>
            <p class="is-justify">
                I'm Niaz. A fresh graduate who completed a B.Sc in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of
                Rajshahi.
            </p>
            <p class="is-justify">
                Mathematics has fascinated me since my childhood. As I grew up, I started mathematical problem solving
                and became quite good at it. I started Competitive Programming when I was a B.Sc 1st-year student. I
                participated in ACM ICPC, Google CodeJam in the past and solved 1000+ problems on various online judges.
                This helped me to build up a solid base in theoretical mathematics and computer programming.
            </p>
            <p class="is-justify">
                I was introduced to Game Development when I was in B.Sc second year. This is the first sector where I
                tried to incorporate my mathematical and programming skills. I've made quite a few Mobile and WebGL
                games using Unity Game Engine. You can find some in the project section. I also did freelancing as a
                game developer in Upwork and Freelancer with the successful completion of three projects. It was
                actually an experiment and the verdict was positive.
            </p>
            <p class="is-justify">
                At the end of the third year, I took a part-time job as a Full-stack web developer in one of my
                university Senior's personal projects who is currently the manager of GulfNet Co. Ltd. in Tokyo, Japan.
                Here I've worked with Angular, Express, MySQL, NodeJs, Ionic, TypeORM, and Bootstrap. I was involved
                with this for almost two years and I've learned a lot.
            </p>
            <p class="is-justify">
                In the last year of my B.Sc, I've worked with designing maze exploration and solving algorithms and
                object detection with Machine Learning algorithms for my B.Sc final year project/thesis.
            </p>
            <p class="is-justify">
                After this beautiful journey in various IT sectors, I've enjoyed Machine Learning most and I think the
                reason behind it is the beauty of mathematics. Game Development will take the second position and then
                the web development.
            </p>
            <p class="is-justify">
                I participated in many competitions, and olympiads in the past. I took many programming sessions as an
                instructor on behalf of BdOSN, US-Embassy Dhaka, and Arduino Community Bangladesh. These activities
                enabled me to acquire strong leadership, project management, networking, and communication skills.
                Besides all of these, sometimes I write mathematical and tech articles on my blog
                (www.niazbinsiraj.com).
